### Description
Implements dimming of clients which are unfocused.

The code also allows any color dimming. There is also an additional option in `Rule`, which allows you to keep the client `neverdim`, that is, as if it is focused.

There are also two functions that can be bound to a `Key` or `Button`, 
1. `toggledimming`: Which toggles dimming for all windows (except for `Rule`s)
2. `toggledimmingclient`: Which toggles dimming for the focused window, as if the client had `neverdim` applied to it. This overwrites an applied `Rule`.
