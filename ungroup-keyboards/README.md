### Description
Ungroup keyboard input devices based on device name.

I wrote this patch was because keyboard device grouping breaks the behaviour of
the ydotool virtual device. This patch fixes my issue #558 in the codeberg
issue tracker.

See the inputdevicerules patch for a more generalised version of this idea.
