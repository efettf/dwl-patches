### Description
Add the meson build system.

This is useful for people who do not want to self-manage a wlroots installation.

To enable Xwayland support, you will need to enable it in the wlroots subproject:
```sh
meson setup -Dwlroots:xwayland=enabled build
```
It is also reccomended to see the wlroots meson project configuration logs for any
unusual checks, such as requiring `hwdata` for the DRM backend.
