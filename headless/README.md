### Description
Implements `swaymsg create_output` command, it allows you to create virtual/headless outputs. But in combination with a VNC server (for example wayvnc), this allows you to essentially have additional monitors, by connecting to the VNC server with an appropiate client (for example on an tablet or laptop).

If you plan to use wayvnc, you'll need [virtual-pointer](https://codeberg.org/dwl/dwl-patches/wiki/virtual-pointer.-) patch as well
